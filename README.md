The implementation of a deep face detection model using Python and TensorFlow involves utilizing pre-trained models designed for efficient face localization.
In this example, the Multi-task Cascaded Convolutional Networks (MTCNN) is employed.
TensorFlow is used for its computational capabilities, and the MTCNN library aids in detecting faces within images.

The process begins by loading the MTCNN model and an image onto which face detection will be applied. 
The image is converted from the default BGR format to RGB, as required by the MTCNN model.
The detector then identifies faces in the image, providing bounding box coordinates. 
These coordinates are used to draw bounding boxes around detected faces, visually highlighting their locations.
The resulting image with annotated faces is displayed for further analysis or visualization.

This implementation serves as a foundational guide for face detection tasks, and users can explore more advanced models or train custom models for specific applications.
The presented code offers a starting point for integrating face detection capabilities into diverse projects, from security systems to computer vision applications.
